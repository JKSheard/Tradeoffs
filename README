This folder contains the code for the project on Testing trade-offs and the dominance-impoverishment rule among ant communities.
This project was based on the combined Master's study work by Jeppe Berggreen and PhD work of Julie K. Sheard in collaboration with supervisors Nathan J. Sanders and Robert R. Dunn and with Annika S. Nelson and Raphael Boulay.

The folder contains five different scripts.
Climate data.R <- for extracting climatic variables from WorldClim based on site coordinates
effect_sizes.Rmd <- For extracting correlation values for the trade-offs at each site to be used in the study of whether environmental variables affect the strength of trade-offs. 
Impoverishment_rule.Rmd <- for testing the Impoverishment rule (The dominance-diversity trade-off)
Mixed_models.Rmd <- For testing whether there is a trade-off in ants between dominance and discovery, dominance and thermal tolerance and dominance and resource generalism and for testing whether environmental variables explain the strength of trade-offs across multiple sites.
t-tests.Rmd <- For testing whether dominant and subordinate species differ in their mean discovery ability, temperature tolerance and resource generalism.
